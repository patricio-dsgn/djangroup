            <p>Developed and proposed for the first time in
                England by Stephen Lewis and Ken Heaton at
                the University Department of Medicine,
                Bristol Royal Infirmary, it was suggested by
                the authors as a clinical assessment tool in
                1997 in the Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology
                after a previous prospective study, conducted in
                on a sample of the population (838 men and 1,059 women),
                had shown an unexpected prevalence of defecation disorders
                related to the shape and type of stool. The authors of
                the former paper concluded that the form of the stool
                is a useful surrogate measure of colon transit time.
                That conclusion has since been challenged as having limited
                validity for Types 1 and 2; however, it remains in use
                as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of
                treatments for various diseases of the bowel, as well as
                a clinical communication aid.</p>
